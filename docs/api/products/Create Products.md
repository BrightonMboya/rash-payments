### Creating Products via Dashboard

You can also create products directly from the dashboard, which is accessible via the platformâ€™s web interface. The dashboard provides a graphical interface for managing products, making it easier to set up and configure products without the need for API calls. This option is recommended for users who prefer a more visual approach or who are managing products individually.

Whether you choose to use the API or the dashboard, both methods ensure that the products are fully integrated into your billing platform.
