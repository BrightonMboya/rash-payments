This project being open source can attract readers and interests from different parts of the world and 
I want to provide as much context as possible so that the end reader can have the correct perspective 
of the problem we're trying to solve. 

For like forever now, Stripe has set up the standards of accepting payments online in the countries where
they support. If you're a Indie dev or a small startup, you can quickly validate your idea by just having
a stripe payment link and that's incredible if you think about how much heavy lifting Stripe has offered you.

Now I live in Tanzania, East Africa where Stripe isn't supported and every time I launch a new idea,
I go through the manual steps of "building my own Stripe" to accept payments. Here is my typical 
flow when I launch a new product.
- I contact my payment provider for example DPO Payments, Flutterwave etc and I get access to their 
payment API. Now this API allows me charge my customers for money. I then have to handle things like
Invoice creation, handle refunds, charge credit card banks, charge out mobile money transfer, do a proper 
financial record keeping for when i want to share the metrics to an investor, or just internal use.
- Build my own billing solution. Yes that's right, I get to build my own in house billing solution that
can change depend on how much this little tiny product of mine gets received by the market. I get to have 
footguns on this billing solution and i get to iterate and improve as it grows. 

I want to stress one thing, this problem gets solved easily by companies like lemonsquezzy, paddle etc. 
In fact majority of the design and lessons of this project is drawn from me using and trying to reverse 
engineer these products to work on my use case. And my use case being "I want to accept mobile money transfers
from my customers". Yes, I can confidently make a claim that at least 95% of all B2C customers prefer 
to pay via mobile money even though they have access to a bank (this is true for all African countries
I have extensively researched on East Africa, West Africa, and Southern African countries). 
I can even summarize its the whole continent, but I haven't researched fully on North Africa so i cant really say.

And so this project is for folks selling digital products in these regions, you don't have to spend
your bunch amount of time trying to get paid and build your own billing solution. This project aims at
reproducing Stripe, Paddle, lemonsquezzy but for mobile money transfers. One more important note is, this
project is meant to be a billing service and we don't process any payments. Our product is designed to 
be compatible with battle tested PSP out there like Cellulant, and DPO Payments.

If there will be demand for this product to accomodate sth like "An open source alternative to Paddle and lemonsquezzy"
then we will do this via integrations sections, but the focus right now is making it easier to sell
digital products in Sub Saharan Africa.

So yes, that is the context o the problem we're trying to solve. I hope I will get the courage to finish 
this project and see it to fruition and I can use it on my personal use. I will be building and documenting
the whole process online and hopefully we can get sth moving from there.
