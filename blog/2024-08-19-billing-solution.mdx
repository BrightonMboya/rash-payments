## The hustle of building a B2B Saas application
We have all been there, we get a new saas idea and we quickly lock in for the next 3 months trying to 
get our idea into the hands of the customers. At first everything seems fine and we are on the way to 10k MRR, 
but then we have to accept payments from our customers. Okay that doesn't look like much of a big deal, a simple 
Google search and we see Stripe as the first option, ooh wait, Stripe is not supported on your country. okay, 
Flutterwave should be able to do this right, ooh it's only supported in a handful African countries. So now what?

Well you could go the route of manually connecting all the APIs and match your business case. Or you can
go ahead and look for a payment provider who has done all that for you and wire it up on your application. With that 
comes a bunch of edge cases that you have to handle and get right otherwise you can miss on huge potential revenues.

Building a proper billing solution can be complicated depending on the areas you want to cover. From Invoicing, 
to upgrade and downgrade plans, to refunds, to cancelling subscriptions. These areas can go as deep and it will take
you longer to go to the market and even miss out on potential revenues.

Say for example we have an enteprise TODO app, the sales team comes to us (engineering team) and say we have 15 customers
lined up and wants to be billed yearly upfront for it. No problem, we spend the next 3-4 weeks building up a billing system
for charging the customers yearly up front. In the middle of development comes a new requirement that we need to support
monthly subscriptions as well and we need to charge per seat. After a rough discussion as to why this requirement
wasn't communicated earlier we decide to support this feature as well, now the project timeline has now moved from
4 weeks to now 8 weeks.  After the full 8 weeks of iteration and deployment, another PM comes in and say we have to add AI
into our TODO app and now that means we have to add "AI usage billing" in our application. You can see where I am going
with this. Our team has collectively spent almost 16 weeks now on just billing solution instead of building and 
shipping the core business logic. What if you're just an Indie dev with no team in place and you have to ship all 
these along your core product to your users, how much time and resources will you be able to spend on just billing solution.


What if there was a soluton that can handle all these for you, a solution that grows with you and your needs and 
allows you to start collecting payments from day one with very simple configuration. With Jani Payments, you just focus on
